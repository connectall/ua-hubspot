 HubSpot is a marketing, sales, and service platform that helps companies to attract visitors, convert leads, and close & retain customers. It does this through a single source of truth, intuitive UX, and a unified codebase. HubSpot equips companies to better manage marketing, sales, service, and operations efforts.

Working Condition:
1) Created scheme for business objects like Ticket, Deal, Task, and Company.
2) The Connection URL must be its api-url (i.e. https://api.hubapi.com) and it uses Bearer token authentication.
3) Attachments and comments are not doable for this due to API Limitation.
